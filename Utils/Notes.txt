ToDo
	Water and Gas physics

World Gen
 - pass in rules
 - biomes?






Gameplay Ideas:
	Oxygin is included, the "outside" keeps a constand pressure
	the game starts with access to the surface
	Trader or trade routes?
	unstable portal that lets you pluck thing from "timespace" (dont worry ppl who you gather are frozen in time)
	starting area is remains of lab
	story: partical accelorator broke time, you are in the future (lab is buriieid) you have to make your way to your home timeline?
	decide if the player is a character, or just the omnipitant base builder, or both (you play in and controll the colony)
		if both idea: you start haveing to be at a console in the cernter of the base but can then make a tablet

	Mix of ONI, Rimworld, and factorio is the direction






Names?
 - The Time After : not very catchy or has a cool acrynim






 toDo: 
	consolitate all the tile maps into one
	each tile will be a struct that has all the diffrent tial types
		this will cut down on memory and also consolidate logic
		bootstrap it so we can still initally use the masters
